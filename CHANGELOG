### CHANGELOG
+ "SaveEachSpectrumResult" in config file saves each spectrum's Fisher and power' estimates
+ R & dv pairs are read from a file, instead of assuming fixed dv for all spectra.
+ Last k edge is now read from config file as `LastKEdge`.
+ Needs CBLAS & LAPACKE libraries to run.
+ Option to turn off copying S and Q matrices in order to reduce time.
+ Logger saves separately for each PE.
+ Use `chrono` library to measure time.
+ GSL flags are silenced in compilation.
+ Tests checking cblas & estimator results are added `make test`.
+ Python script does not fit, but applies a weighted smoothing.
+ Default velocity is logarithmic. Changed the key in config.param
+ Implemented reading a mean flux file, which changed config.param keys
+ Created continuum marginalization coeffecients under specifics namespace. Read from config file.
+ Removed redshift evolution option
+ Each PE reads and sorts its own spectra, then merge sorted. This saves significant amount of time reading ~1m files.
+ Smoothing script has --interp_log option, which can be enabled by setting SmoothLnkLnP to 1 in config.param

### mpi-v1.3
+ Signal and derivative look up tables are controlled by one class: [sq_table.hpp](core/sq_table.hpp)
+ Input data are assumed to be fluctuations and not flux. Added `ConvertFromFluxToDeltaf` to config file to switch behaviors.
+ Using Lee12 mean flux option is removed. A better candidate would be interpolating an input flux file. 
+ Signal matrix interpolation axes are reversed to speed up the integration. This makes previous tables uncompetable.
+ MPI branch has been removed of any OpenMP code.
+ Fiducial cosmology has default parameters:

    A      =    6.621420e-02
    n      =   -2.685349e+00
    alpha  =   -2.232763e-01
    B      =    3.591244e+00
    beta   =   -1.768045e-01
    lambda =    3.598261e+02

+ When `FiducialPowerFile` set in config file, an interpolation function takes over. This file should be a binary file and have the following convention:

    Nk Nz
    z[1]...z[Nz]
    k[1]...k[Nk]
    P[nz=1, nk=1...Nk]...P[Nz, nk=1...Nk]

+ Some functions are turned into `inline`.
+ The large number added to covariance matrix is 100.

### v1.2
+ Turn of redshift evolution by passing `--disable-redshift-evolution` to configure script. When redshift evolution is turned off, every pixel pair in each chunk assumed to be at the median redshift of the chunk, and switched to using top-hat bins. However, scaling with a growth function is still functional if passed. Using `beta=0` in fiducial power is recomended.
+ Detailed power spectrum output has build and configuration specifics in the beginning.
+ Log to both `OutputDir` log files and `stdout/stderr`. Save time statistics to `OutputDir/time_log.txt` in fixed width table.
+ Throw `std::runtime_error(msg)` instead of only message.

### v1.1
+ Prints detailed power spectrum output file.
+ Computes Fisher matrix weighted d (raw power), b (noise estimate) and t (fiducial signal estimate) values storing 3 more gsl_vectors.

v1
=====
+ Set `UseLogarithmicVelocity` in config file to 1 to convert by logarithmic spacing.
+ All redshift binning schemes scales derivative matrices with fiducial growth unless `--disable-redshift-growth` is passed to configure or `-DREDSHIFT_GROWTH_POWER` is not passed to preprocessor.
+ Convergence checks if estimated error is negative. Negative errors are substituted with infinite error *only* in convergence---Fisher matrix is not modified.
+ Load balancing takes how many matrices are needed in triangular bins into account. Some bins are skipped since no pixel pair belongs to them.
+ Specify allocated memory in MB to store additional derivative matrices and fiducial signal matrix if possible. This speeds up calculations.
+ The large number added to covariance matrix is 10000.
