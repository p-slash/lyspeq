# Prerequisites
[FFTW3](http://www.fftw.org/) is needed for fast Fourier transforms.

[GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) is needed for matrix arithmetic, integration and interpolation.

# Overview of Programs

**LyaPowerEstimate** iterates over multiple qso spectra and estimates one-dimensional Lya power spectrum 
in the line-of-sight. It maximizes likelihood using Newton-Raphson method.

**CreateSQLookUpTable** creates look up tables for signal and derivative matrices used in LyaPowerEstimate.

Both programs take one common config file.

# Config File
Config file has one file list for qso spectra. This txt file should start with number of qso and 
then have relative file paths.

Bin edges for k start with linear spacing: `K0 + LinearKBinWidth * n`, where `n =[0, NumberOfLinearBins]`.
Then continues with log spacing: `K_edgde[NumberOfLinearBins] * 10^(Log10KBinWidth * n)`
Parameters for k binning are:

    K0 1E-4

    NumberOfLinearBins    5
    NumberOfLog10Bins     13

    LinearKBinWidth       2E-4
    Log10KBinWidth        0.1

Redshift bins are linearly spaced.

    FirstRedshiftBinCenter    1.9
    RedshiftBinWidth          0.2
    NumberOfRedshiftBins      6

If the power spectrum is fitted with a smooth polynomial of ln k, its degree is

    PolynomialDegree    2

The location of the file list, and the directory where those files live:

    FileNameList      qso_list.txt
    FileInputDir      ./qso_dir/

The directory for output files and file name base:

    OutputDir         /Users/nk452/repos/data/Quadratic_test
    OutputFileBase    lya_qde_10mocks_binary

The maximum number of iterations are

    NumberOfIterations    10

List of spectograph resolutions (R) is in `FileNameRList`. This file starts with number of Rs.

    FileNameRList     ./specres_list.txt

Lookup tables are generated with the following parameters:

    NumberVPoints     200
    NumberZPoints     200
    PixelWidth        4.0
    VelocityLength    1000.

These lookup tables are saved with the follwoing file name bases to `FileInputDir`:

    SignalLookUpTableBase          signal_lookup
    DerivativeSLookUpTableBase     derivative_lookup

# Quasar Spectrum File
Quasar spectrum file is in binary format. It starts with a header (see [QSOFile](io/qso_file.hpp)), 
then has wavelength, flux and noise in double arrays.
