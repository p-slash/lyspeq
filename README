LyaPowerEstimate iterates over multiple qso spectra and estimates one-dimensional Lya power spectrum in the line-of-sight. It maximizes likelihood using Newton-Raphson method.

==========================================
Takes one config file.
Parameters for binning are:
////
K0 
K1 
NumberOfBins 
LinLog 
\\\\
Bin edges are defined as K0 + K1 * n, where n is from 0 to NumberOfBins+1. If LinLog is 10, then these are powers of 10.

If the power spectrum is fitted with a smooth polynomial of ln k, its degree is
////
PolynomialDegree 
\\\\

The location of the file list, and the directory where those files live:
////
FileNameList qso_list.txt
FileInputDir ./qso_dir/
\\\\

The directory for output files and file name base:
////
OutputDir /Users/nk452/repos/data/Quadratic_test
OutputFileBase lya_qde_10mocks_binary
\\\\

////
NumberOfIterations 10
\\\\

==========================================
Config file has one file list for qso spectra. This txt file should start with number of qso and then have relative file paths.

==========================================
Quasar spectrum file is in binary format. It starts with a header (see io/qso_file.hpp), then has wavelength, flux and noise in double arrays.
